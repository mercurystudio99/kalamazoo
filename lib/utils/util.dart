You have the right to obtain free information about what personal data we have obtained about you, where it is stored, for how long, for what purposes it is used, to whom it was disclosed. You have the right to have us, without undue delay, rectify of inaccurate personal data concerning you. That means you can request we change your personal data in our records, or have your incomplete personal data completed. You have the “right to be forgotten,” i.e. to have us delete your personal information, without undue delay, if the data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected. However, GDPR gives us the right to refuse erasure if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for keeping your information.\n\n"

          "    i.  If you contest the accuracy of your personal data, we will restrict processing it for a period enabling us to verify its accuracy.\n"
          "    ii.  The processing is unlawful and you oppose its erasure and request instead the restriction of its use.\n"

You have the right to transmit that data to another controller if doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.\n\n"

You can object, on grounds relating your particular situation, at any time, to processing of your personal information, if based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR.

If you object to the processing for direct marketing purposes, we will have to stop processing for these purposes.\n\n"
